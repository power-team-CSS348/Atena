# project-db
For the project, we chose the theme Airport. Choosing a topic for the project, we thought about whether it would not be easy enough and whether it would be interesting. We wanted to learn something new and interesting through the project. And our goal is to make a good, high-quality and convenient website.

When determining the scope of the project, we were interested in what we could do and whether it would be too simple. We will have a website where you can book and buy tickets. There are also such operations as cancellation of reservations and the site itself will contain information about passengers, tickets, and flights.

In our team, we have only a little experience in the layout of the website. Therefore, we did not hesitate to choose a website.

We will write our website in PHP. For the database server, we chose Sqlite. We think that this is convenient and it will help us during the course.
