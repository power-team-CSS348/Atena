In our project, we chose the airport. .
The tasks of the airport include: control and management of the movement of aircraft, baggage inspection. The airport also works closely with airlines.
Airlines form flights, the airport makes and adjusts the schedule of movement depending on the workload of the runway, provides a parking space for airline aircraft. Airports are equipped with waiting rooms, where you can see information about the nearest flights on the information board.
In the modern information society, like many organizations, the airport should have its own website, where, for the convenience of users, it would be possible to view information about the nearest flights without leaving home, as well as book a ticket. Booking of air tickets should consist of several stages:

1. Route selection
2. Select the fare offered by the airline
3. Filling in passenger data
4. Choosing the payment and delivery method

The last step is to send the completed data directly to the airline, which contacts the buyer and makes the sale.
The security service is engaged in baggage inspection, in case of successful passage, puts a special mark. In case of failure, establishes contact with the passenger through the airline.
