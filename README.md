Advanced Database Management Systems Project

Description of the project 
=====================
In our project, we chose the airport. .
The tasks of the airport include: control and management of the movement of aircraft, baggage inspection. The airport also works closely with airlines.
Airlines form flights, the airport makes and adjusts the schedule of movement depending on the workload of the runway, provides a parking space for airline aircraft. Airports are equipped with waiting rooms, where you can see information about the nearest flights on the information board.
In the modern information society, like many organizations, the airport should have its own website, where, for the convenience of users, it would be possible to view information about the nearest flights without leaving home, as well as book a ticket. Booking of air tickets should consist of several stages:

1. Route selection
2. Select the fare offered by the airline
3. Filling in passenger data
4. Choosing the payment and delivery method

The last step is to send the completed data directly to the airline, which contacts the buyer and makes the sale.
The security service is engaged in baggage inspection, in case of successful passage, puts a special mark. In case of failure, establishes contact with the passenger through the airline.


The formation of a flight for an airport includes entering information about the departure time, arrival time, airline, aircraft model, departure and arrival location into the database. Flights are formed by airlines.
Control of the movement of aircraft is carried out by the airport dispatcher. It gives permission for take-off / landing, records delays, unforeseen circumstances, and monitors weather conditions.
The airport must book and sell tickets through the information portal-the website. There you can search, choose a suitable fare, fill in information about passengers, choose a payment method and delivery. Then the completed data is sent directly to the airline, which is engaged in the sale of tickets.
Baggage inspection is carried out by the airport security service. Each baggage is sealed and viewed on an X-ray machine. Next, loading takes place in the cargo compartment of the aircraft. The security service, in case of successful verification, puts a special stamp on the luggage. In case of failure, the security service should contact the passenger.


Goal
------
The main purpose is to record the movement of aircraft and provide information about flights associated with this airport. A secondary task is the sale of tickets.

User Tasks
-----------
The airline must create a record of a new flight or make changes to existing records. The airline is also engaged in updating the data filled in on the booking page, selling tickets. The airline enters information about the number of remaining seats on the plane.
The dispatcher enters information about events related to the aircraft, namely, departure time, landing time, delays and even cancellations.
The Internet portal should search for flights by criteria and book tickets.
The buyer searches for a suitable fare, based on the search criteria, and books tickets.
The tasks of the manager include viewing reports and adding or changing information about airlines.

Data Processing
----------------
1. Automatic change of flight status (departed, scheduled, delayed or canceled)
2. Calculation of the fare cost based on the flights included in it and the number of passengers
3. Calculation of arrival time based on departure time and flight duration
4. Calculation of arrival and departure times in local time, relative to the location of the aircraft
5. Checking the correctness of the completed data on events related to the aircraft. Includes the following checks:
• No more than one departure event and one arrival event can be created on the same flight
• The "arrived" event cannot be created if there is no "departed" event
• The "departed" event cannot be created if it is later than the "arrived" event
• The "arrived" event cannot be created if it is earlier than the "departed" event»

Platform - WEB
---------------
We will use Python for our app.
1) Table-Aircompany contains Aircompany name, Aircompany Phone, Aircompany Adress
2) The  AirPort table contains Airport idCity, Airport Name
3) 


ER DIAGRAM
------------
We have created an Entity-Relationship diagram
